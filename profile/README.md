## Publications

We are proud of our contributions to the scientific community. Below is a list of some of our key publications that highlight our expertise and impact:

1. **[The Transformative Potential of AI in Obstetrics and Gynaecology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2023.102277)** - The transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping diverse domains of medicine. Recent progress, catalyzed by computing advancements, has seen commensurate adoption of AI technologies within obstetrics and gynaecology. We explore the use and potential of AI in three focus areas: predictive modeling for pregnancy complications, Deep learning-based image interpretation for precise diagnoses, and large language models enabling intelligent health care assistants. We also provide recommendations for the ethical implementation, governance of AI, and promote research into AI explainability, which are crucial for responsible AI integration and deployment. AI promises a revolutionary era of personalized health care in obstetrics and gynaecology.
2. **[Reciprocal Perspective as a Super Learner Improves Drug-Target Interaction Prediction (MUSDTI)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16493-9)** - This study introduces a novel deep learning-based meta-model for drug-target interaction prediction, formulated by leveraging 28 student-produced models, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates significant improvements using the Reciprocal Perspective multi-view learning framework, highlighting its potential for enhancing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.
3. **[Algorithmic Thinking in the Public Interest: Navigating Technical, Legal, and Ethical Hurdles to Web Scraping in the Social Sciences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-021-01164-0)** - extraction, discussing its benefits, challenges, and proposing "algorithmic thinking in the public interest" to navigate technical, legal, and ethical hurdles, thus enhancing access to online information and scholarly discourse.
4. **[Gasbotty: Multi-Metric Extraction in the Wild](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9727170)** - This study introduces the Gas Prices of America (GPA) dataset and the GasBotty predictor for accurately detecting and contextually associating gas prices from natural imagery, achieving a significant 72.9% "All-or-Nothing Accuracy" and setting a new benchmark for multi-metric extraction in the wild.
5. **[Predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder: Transformer-Based Deep Learning Ensemble Framework Using Health Administrative & Birth Registry Data](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.03.24309684)** - 
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning models on health administrative and birth registry data to identify young children at high risk of developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD), achieving promising predictive accuracy and enabling earlier diagnosis and access to essential resources and support.
